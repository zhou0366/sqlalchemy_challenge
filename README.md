# SQLAlchemy Surfs Up
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.![output]

## Precipitation Analysis

The precipitation for the 1-year shown displays around 4 times where there are large spikes in precipitation over a few days. Ignoring these spikes, the period with the least amount of precipitation occurs from January to April during this period. The heaviest precipitation occurs between August through December. Based on the plot of this year's data, the ideal period is between January and April. 

## Station Analysis

The histogram shows that the station's median temperature is around 75 degrees with a skew to the left.
